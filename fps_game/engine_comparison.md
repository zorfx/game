# Browser-Based FPS Game Engine Comparison

## Requirements
- Mobile-first FPS game similar to Dusk or Quake
- Smooth performance on mobile devices
- Support for secret areas
- 6-7 versatile weapons
- Browser playable
- Capability to add more levels

## Engine Options

### Babylon.js

**Pros:**
- Powerful 3D rendering engine with excellent WebGL support
- Recently released version 7.0 with performance improvements
- Built-in physics support with Havok integration
- Good documentation and active community
- FPS examples available (https://www.babylonjs-playground.com/#E8C51D#33)
- Counterstrike-style demo available (https://cs16.herokuapp.com/)
- Advanced animation system with blending capabilities
- Good support for collision detection and ray casting (important for FPS mechanics)
- Comprehensive GUI system for weapon HUD and menus

**Cons:**
- May require more setup for mobile-specific optimizations
- Some examples are not complete FPS implementations
- Steeper learning curve compared to some alternatives

### PlayCanvas

**Pros:**
- Purpose-built for games with an editor similar to Unity
- Good mobile performance (especially on newer devices)
- Built-in collaboration features
- Visual editor makes level design more accessible
- Good for team-based development
- FPS tutorials and examples available
- Cross-platform support explicitly mentioned for mobile devices

**Cons:**
- Performance issues reported on older Android devices
- Post-processing effects can significantly impact mobile performance
- May require more manual optimization for consistent performance across devices
- Free tier has limitations for private projects

### Three.js

**Pros:**
- Lightweight and flexible
- Extensive examples and documentation
- Large community and ecosystem
- Good for custom implementations
- FPS examples and starter code available
- Can achieve good performance with proper optimization
- More direct control over rendering pipeline

**Cons:**
- More low-level than other options, requiring more custom code
- Less game-specific features out of the box
- Mobile performance varies widely based on implementation
- Would need to build more game systems from scratch
- No built-in physics (would need to integrate Ammo.js or similar)

## Performance Considerations

### Mobile Performance
- **Babylon.js**: Good performance with proper optimization, physics may impact performance
- **PlayCanvas**: Excellent on newer devices, issues reported on older Android devices
- **Three.js**: Highly dependent on implementation, requires careful optimization

### Rendering Capabilities
- **Babylon.js**: Advanced rendering with PBR materials, global illumination in v7.0
- **PlayCanvas**: Good rendering with PBR support, optimized for games
- **Three.js**: Flexible rendering, but requires more manual setup

### Asset Loading
- **Babylon.js**: Excellent glTF support, good for model loading
- **PlayCanvas**: Good asset management through editor
- **Three.js**: Support for various formats, but may require more manual handling

## Feature Implementation

### Weapons System
- **Babylon.js**: Good examples for weapon interfaces, shooting mechanics
- **PlayCanvas**: FPS tutorials available with weapon implementation
- **Three.js**: Would require more custom implementation

### Secret Areas
- **Babylon.js**: Good collision and physics system for implementing hidden areas
- **PlayCanvas**: Level editor makes creating secret areas more visual
- **Three.js**: Would require custom implementation

### Level Design
- **Babylon.js**: Programmatic approach, can import from modeling tools
- **PlayCanvas**: Visual editor makes level design more accessible
- **Three.js**: More programmatic, would need custom tools or import from external editors

## Recommendation

Based on the research and requirements, **Babylon.js** appears to be the most suitable engine for this project for the following reasons:

1. It has good examples specifically for FPS games
2. The physics system will be valuable for implementing weapons and secret areas
3. The animation system supports blending, which will be useful for weapon animations
4. Good documentation and active community support
5. Recent performance improvements in version 7.0
6. Strong mobile support with proper optimization

PlayCanvas would be a good alternative if a more visual development approach is preferred, but Babylon.js offers a better balance of features, performance, and FPS-specific capabilities for this project.

## Next Steps

1. Set up development environment with Babylon.js
2. Create basic FPS mechanics based on available examples
3. Implement mobile-specific controls and optimizations
4. Develop the weapons system
5. Create level design system with support for secret areas
